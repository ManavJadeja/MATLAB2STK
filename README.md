# MATLABtoSTK

MAIN CAPABILITIES
1) Creating simulations in MATLAB
2) Automation of STK with MATLAB Integration
3) Visualization of simulation in Systems Tool Kit (STK)

MATLAB USES
> Rotations
> Creating attitude file (.a files) for STK
> Automation of STK

STK CAPABILITIES
> Creating and managing scenario information
> Adding and modifying objects
    > Facility (location and altitude)
    > Satellites (orbit, attitude, and sensors)
    > Sensors (constraints and properties)
> Computing access between objects
> Visualizations of satellite attitude dynamics

FUTURE GOALS
> Add sequential maneuver capabilities
    > Multiple attitude dynamics (without instantaneous jumps)
> Support for slosh dynamics (rotationalDynamics >> sloshDynamics)
    > Support for slosh dynamics (build on rotations)
> Importing control systems (Simulink >> MATLAB >> STK)
